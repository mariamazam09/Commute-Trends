## The Commute Challenge
Every day, people leave their homes to get to work. But The way people commute to work isn’t always a matter of choice. It often depends on what’s accessible, affordable, and available. So commuting to work has its own challenges such as traffic congestion, safety concerns, limited public transport services, and disparities existing across regions and ethnicities. A clear understanding of commuting behaviour is crucial for developing effective transport solutions. 

## Bahrain 2030 Vision: Transport Highlights
The core idea aligns with Bahrain 2030 vision that says "A world-class infrastructure links Bahrain to the global economy".
The Kingdom aims to establish efficient transport networks that are both affordable & accessible, in partnership with private sector. 

## Analyzing California Commute Trends as a Case Study
California has varying commuting choices across regions and ethnic groups, raising important questions about the inclusiveness and efficiency of the transportation system. It has longstanding challenges with traffic congestion and mobility, making it a valuable case study to reflect on what strategies are working in Bahrain and what lessons might apply to Bahrain's Transport future.

## Objectives
1. Explore Geographic and Demographic Trends in Commute Choices
2. Understand Influence of Socioeconomic Factors i.e., income on Commute Choices
3. Assess Overtime Shifts in Commute Patterns
4. Extract Insights Applicable to Bahrain Transportation Goals

## Dataset Overview
To conduct analysis, two datasets from US Census Bureau were used. The main dataset that covers most of the analysis has features i.e., report year, geography, ethnicity, commute modes, and population. The data covers the years 2000, and 2005-2010, and it has information on commute modes used by people 16 aged and older - which is the minimum eligible driving age in California.
The second supplementary dataset has information on household income across counties.

## Key Analytical Findings
### 🔹 1. Geographical Trends

➤ Driving Alone Dominates Across All Regions

The vast majority of people, over 75%, commute by driving alone. This holds true across nearly all regions, making solo driving the most dominant commute choice.

Carpooling ranks second but is used by a much smaller share.

➤ Transit Usage Doesn’t Always Align with Population Size

When we look at the top 10 most populated regions, we notice something interesting. 

Even though Southern California has the highest population, public transit use there is lower than in the Bay Area.

This tells us that population size alone doesn’t determine transit usage. Factors like infrastructure, connectivity, and trust likely play a bigger role

### 🔹 2. Demographic Trends

➤ African Americans Have the Highest Transit Use

African Americans have the highest rate of public transit use, while the White population has the lowest.

### 🔹 3. Socioeconomic Patterns | Income

➤ Driving Alone Is Common Across All Income Levels

The assumption was for lower-income groups to rely more on public transit, but the data showed otherwise. 

Across all income levels, driving alone remains the most common choice.

Surprisingly, low- and middle-income groups are more likely to walk than use public transit.

### 🔹 4. Shifting Commute Modes Over Time 

➤ Carpooling and Walking Decline, Public Transit Stagnates

Carpooling and walking have steadily declined since 2000. Public transit, meanwhile, has remained largely stagnant, showing little to no growth over a full decade.

These patterns suggest that alternative modes are losing traction, and public transit has failed to gain momentum

## What the Data Reveals:
Here are three key insights the analysis revealed:
- Driving alone dominates, regardless of region, income, or population size, making it the default mode of transport.
- Public transit remains underused, even by low-income groups, highlighting systemic and behavioral barriers.
- Shared and active commute modes are declining, while transit growth remains stagnant, pointing to missed opportunities for inclusive transport.

## Bahrain vs. California: Recent Trends
Now that we’ve looked at past trends, let’s briefly compare how California and Bahrain have evolved in more recent years.
- In California, transit ridership has continued to decline even after 2010. This is mostly due to rising car ownership, the growth of ride-hailing services, and shifting residential patterns, all of which made transit less appealing.
- In contrast, Bahrain has been making progress. The government has expanded its bus network, upgraded terminals, and improved service frequency. But despite these efforts, public adoption remains low, largely due to issues like walkability, weather, comfort, and lack of public awareness.
- California’s transit coverage is widespread but still underutilized while Bahrain’s network is more limited, especially in reaching residential zones. This contrast highlights the gap between infrastructure availability and actual usability, which ties back to public behavior and accessibility.

## Online Voices on Bahrain Public Transport
Since there was no official sentiment data, public conversations on platforms like Reddit were reviewed. 
Key concerns that emerged were: 
- Car-centric Culture
- Long wait times
- Uncomfortable walking conditions
- Unclear routes
- General lack of trust in the system.
These comments offer a real-world glimpse into how the public experiences transit beyond numbers, and reflect why many still prefer driving.

## Recommendations | Takeaways for Bahrain’s Transport Future
### 1. Collect Local Data to Inform Policy
Gather national commuting data and incorporate richer external factors (e.g., regional aspects, occupation, income levels) for Bahrain-specific insights

### 2. Boost Transit Design & Access
Assess the needs of different population groups (low-income workers) to ensure transit is accessible for diverse groups

### 3. Enhance Walking Infrastructure
Improve walking conditions around residential and commercial areas with safe & shaded Infrastructure

### 4. Promote Transit Confidence & Culture
Launch awareness efforts that reshape public perception, increase trust in public transit, and reduce car dependence, directly aligning with Bahrain’s transportation goals
